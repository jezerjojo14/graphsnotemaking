# graphsnotemaking

A very weirdly put tool I'm currently using to keep track of the papers I download for my thesis and how they relate to each other.
This web app helps visualize each paper as a node in a forest graph.
It's a Django web app that I wrote a batch file to run locally because I don't have experience creating normal Windows applications.
The workflow is convoluted and involves editing a json file to manually add the details for each paper.
It is not refined for general public use, and I don't plan on working on it any further to meet that end.
But if anyone does want to work on creating a refined version, feel free to fork this repository and do so.
